= Use Mac keyboard with AutoHotkey under Windows

This [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) configuration file makes usual keyboard shortcuts work with an Apple keyboard on Windows. It has been testet with a german keyboard layout, but should work under different layouts as well.

== Installation

- Install [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) 
- Run the `MacKeyboard.ahk` file
- Put the `MacKeyboard.ahk` file or a shortcut to the file in your Autostart folder to run it automatically on startup.
